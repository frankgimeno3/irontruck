                        <h3>How to Send a Pallet?</h3>
                        <div className="Guidelines">
                            <h3>To send a European, American or special pallet, it is important to follow a series of guidelines regarding the palletization and placement of the goods:</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Make sure the base pallet you are going to use is in good condition.</li>
                                <li>Take into account the weight that will be on top of the pallet and whether it will be able to support the load.</li>
                                <li>Place the heaviest and bulkiest goods on the bottom and the lighter and smaller ones on top.</li>
                                <li>Protect the goods and make sure they will not move during transportation.</li>
                                <li>Check the load and give your approval to start shipping your pallets.</li>
                            </ul>

                        <h3>Common Mistakes When Sending Pallets</h3>
                        <div className="Guidelines">
                            <h4>When sending a pallet, there are several common mistakes that can lead to problems during transportation:</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Not securing the goods properly: one of the most common problems when sending palletized goods is that they move during transportation, which can cause damage to the products. To avoid this, make sure the boxes are properly placed on the pallet and use appropriate packaging materials.</li>
                                <li>Choosing the wrong size of pallet: the size of the pallet should be chosen based on the specific needs of the shipment and the characteristics of the goods.</li>
                                <li>Not considering the environment: the environment through which the goods will pass during transportation should be taken into account, and appropriate measures should be taken to protect the goods from factors such as humidity or temperature fluctuations.</li>
                            </ul>
